This extension circumvents certain techniques some websites used by, such as Google or Linkprice.

## What does this extension do?

[한국어 설명](http://macnews.tistory.com/3663)

As described. Some websites are probably tracking what you're doing right now or what page you're looking at, by when you click a link to get other page you may need.
So anyway, this enables you to be free from them by changing the target URL in a link tag when you click a hyperlink.

## How do I get started?

This extension works perfectly with Chrome and Firefox, other browsers are not tested yet but support some browsers which support [WindowBase64 helper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64) and have UserScript plugin.
